<h3>About</h3>
<p>The codeRIT Mental Health hackathon is organized and presented in partnership with the RIT Counseling and Psychological Services office. This hackathon is aimed at informing the RIT community on the importance of mental health within technology. Through 
technology participants are encouraged to analyze and present many mental related health issues. Attendees will develop projects from scratch in an effort to aid mental health efforts within the RIT community. After the event we hope attendees will have a 
better understanding of critical mental health issues that are happening throughout the world.</p>
